We believe that parents are key stakeholders in education. It is, therefore, important for parents to work together with the school to realise the desired outcomes of education. We warmly invite parents to sign up as a Parent Volunteers to support the school in its programmes.

Parents who are interested can sign up through this online form atÂ [https://go.gov.sg/beaconpv](https://go.gov.sg/beaconpv)
