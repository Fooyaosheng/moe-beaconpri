### School Service Providers

School service providers provide services that complement and support the delivery of curriculum and programmes. These services contribute towards the childâ€™s well-being as well as creating an environment conducive for teaching and learning.  
  
#### School Canteen

The stalls in the school canteen serve:

*   Muslim cooked food (rice, assorted dishes, and noodles)
*   Chinese cooked food (rice, assorted dishes, and noodles)
*   Cold drinks and cut fruits
*   Hot drinks and snack

Although the school does not have a dedicated stall selling vegetarian food, students who are on a vegetarian diet may purchase the required food from the stalls selling Chinese cooked food and snacks. Students with special or strict dietary requirements are encouraged to bring their own food.
