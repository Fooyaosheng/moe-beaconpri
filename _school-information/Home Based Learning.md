### Home-Based Learning

In the event of school closures, Home-Based Learning (HBL) activities will be assigned by teachers to ensure continuity of learning. These activities include videos, textbook reading, work book tasks, online work, etc.

#### HBL Instructions

You may access the HBL Site for learning activity instructions. The site will be updated by 7 pm for the following day's learning activities.

Please follow these steps to log in to the [HBL Site &gt;&gt;](https://go.gov.sg/bcps-hbl-site)

#### E-Learning Platforms

Your child would have been given access to various online learning platforms like SLS, Google Suites, E-Zhishi, Raz-Kids (P1 to P4), Koobits, etc. Should you face issues accessing the online platforms, please email [beaconprisch_ICT@moe.edu.sg](mailto:beaconprisch_ICT@moe.edu.sg).

Please include your child's name and class in your email.

**Safety and Security of E-Learning Platforms**<br>
Teachers have put in place multiple measures to prevent uninvited participants from entering these platforms. Some of these measures include:

*   Password protection of sessions
*   Joining instructions located within a secured platform (SLS or Google Classroom)
*   Identification of participants before admission to the session

#### Learning Device Access

Please provide your child with the means to access instructions and learning activities.

*   Personal Learning Device (computer, tablet, smart phone)
*   Headphones/earphones and microphone
*   Internet access

You may refer to the [B121 page](/beacon-experiential-learning/Special-Programmes/b121/) for more information on what laptop specifications are recommended for students.

**Loan of Learning Devices**<br>
If you need to loan a learning device for your child, please email [beaconprisch_ICT@moe.edu.sg](mailto:beaconprisch_ICT@moe.edu.sg) to request. Please note that as devices available for loan are limited, please try to work within your household to share devices first.

**Families on Financial Assistance**<br>
IMDA is introducing a new DigitalAccess@Home scheme to provide subsidised broadband and digital devices (laptop or tablet) to low-income Singaporean households to strengthen digital inclusion. The scheme will replace the existing Home Access and NEU PC Plus programmes.&nbsp;

From 3 April 2023, applicants may apply for the DigitalAccess@Home scheme online ([www.digitalaccess.gov.sg](http://www.digitalaccess.gov.sg/)) or by submitting a hardcopy application. They can also approach any of the 37 SG Digital community hubs and 4 self-help groups (CDAC, Eurasian Association, MENDAKI, SINDA) for assistance with applications.

#### Support for Teacher-Student Live Interaction Sessions

Your child's teachers would be conducting live lesson or interaction sessions on HBL days. The teachers will be specifying the live session timing on the HBL instructions. To support the the sessions your child should prepare the following:

*   Headphones/earphones
*   Microphone
*   Web camera

**Live Session Applications**<br>
Please assist your child with setting up the following applications to allow the use of a microphone and camera:

*   [Google Meet (web-based)](https://meet.google.com/?pli=1) - Log in with your child's Google Suites account.
*   [Google Hangouts (web-based)](https://hangouts.google.com/) - Log in with your child's Google Suites account.
*   [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) - Create an account using your child's Google Suites account. Download the application for easier usage.

As teachers continue to innovate and introduce other web-based applications (Kahoot, Nearpod, Quizziz, etc.) for lessons, we seek your understanding and patience in guiding your child to navigate these applications.

**Live Session Etiquette**<br>
During live sessions, your child should also observe the following etiquette:

*   **Be ready 5 minutes before** the specified time
*   **Be dressed appropriately** in **PE shirt** (not topless or pyjamas)
*   **Clear background** with no distracting posters, photos or undergarments
*   **Hair** should be neat
*   **Face** should be **clearly seen**, not covered
*   **Use hand signals** as instructed by the teachers (thumbs up, down, 1 ,2, 3 etc.)
*   **Mute the microphone** unless they need to speak
*   **Avoid eating** on screen
*   **Avoid offensive language or hand gestures**
*   **Avoid laughing, screaming or shouting loudly** when the microphone is turned on
*   **Avoid chatting** with others in the background

Please advise other members of the household to be mindful of their behaviour while your child is in a live session. As other students in the live session can see and hear what is happening in the background, please take additional care when walking past your child, live session etiquette mentioned above should be adhered by other family members.

**Recording of Live Sessions**<br>
Please note that live sessions may be recorded to support others who are unable to join in at the specified time.

#### Staggered Online Access

To ensure the various e-learning platforms are able to cope with the high volume of usage, students are encouraged to log in based on their timetable.
