### School Rules And Practices

**School Rules**
<br>Students must adhere to the school's Code of Conduct and school rules. There will be disciplinary actions for infringement of the school rules and general conduct. The school will take the necessary actions in the best interest of our students, school staff and the community. 

1. **National Anthem and Pledge-Taking**
* Students who are Singapore Citizens must stand at attention when singing the National Anthem and taking the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with their right fists placed over their left chests.

2. **Importance of Punctuality**
* It is important that students develop the good habit of being punctual for school. They should come prepared to start a new school day after a good night's sleep and proper breakfast. The canteen is open for breakfast for those who are early.
* Students who arrive after 7.30 am are considered late. When students arrive late, they will miss essential instructions given at the beginning of the day. Students who are late also feel uncomfortable entering classes when lessons have already started. The following is the process to discourage students from developing the unhealthy habit of being late for school:

3. **Absence from School**<br>
* Students who are absent from school must produce a medical certificate or letter from parents/guardians to state the reason(s) for their absence. Absence from examination/test must be supported with a medical certificate.
* Students' attendance will be marked by teachers using School Cockpit mobile. An alert, via SMS, will be given to parents at 9.30 am if students are not in school. The time of alert is to provide allowance for students who could have been late for school.
* Students are not allowed to miss school during school term. The school does not have the authority to grant leave for students to miss school. Students should not be away from school before the school holidays or report school late when term has started. Only exceptions such as bereavement and serious illnesses of immediate family members will be considered.

4. **Mobile phones and Smart watches**
* Students are strongly discouraged from bringing mobile phones and smart watches to school.
* Digital clocks are available in the classrooms and other venues in the school if the students need to refer to time.
* In times of emergency, students can make telephone calls from the public payphone next to the bookshop.
* If parents need to have urgent contact with their children during school hours in times of emergency, they can call the General Office to leave a message.

5. **Restricted Areas**
* For safety reasons, students are not to enter areas that are out of bounds and areas that require adult supervision such as the school's eco-pond, butterfly haven and fitness playground.

6. **Prohibited Items**
* Students are not allowed to bring any weapon-like item that could be used or intended to be used to cause harm to others.
* Students are not allowed to bring or be in possession of any unauthorised materials that the school deem inappropriate for students.

7. **Games and cards/toys**
* Students are not allowed to bring any trading cards, toys or games to school. Anyone caught bringing/ playing/trading with these items, will face the possibility of confiscation and other consequences.

#### Homework Policy

8. **Purpose of Homework**
* Homework consolidates and reinforces students' learning and cultivates a healthy disposition towards continual learning. It also provides feedback on students' learning progress for themselves and their parents.

9. **Types of Homework**
* Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required to complete outside curriculum time. This includes hardcopy, online assignments, projects and going through learning materials. 

10. **Roles of Parents**

* Check your child's homework and offer guidance where necessary, but do not do the work for them.
* Communicate with your child's teachers to stay informed about his/her learning progress.
* Provide positive reinforcement - praise your child for his/her efforts and achievements and offer constructive feedback to help him/her improve.

11. **Roles of Students**
* Refer to the whiteboard in the classroom for homework assignments.
* Record the homework assignments in the Beacon Handbook.
* Ensure your homework assignments are brought home to be completed and not left in school.
