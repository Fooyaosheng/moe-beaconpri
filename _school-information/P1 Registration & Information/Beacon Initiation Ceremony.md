## Beacon Initiation Ceremony

The Beacon Initiation Ceremony is a special occasion to welcome the new cohort of students into the Beacon community of learners. It also initiates our students into the Beacon Culture which encourages all members of the Beacon community to SHINE - Serve with compassion, Honour relationships with integrity, Innovate with passion, Navigate with resourcefulness and Excel through ownership in learning.&nbsp; Each student receives their initiation symbol, a medal, on stage from the school leaders. Witnessed by their parents, they can pledge their commitment to do their best for themselves and the school. This symbolic event reminds students of their commitment to excellence and responsibility as Beacons.
