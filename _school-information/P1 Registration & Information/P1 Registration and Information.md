### P1 Registration and Information

In line with the measures announced by the Government to further enhance safe distancing measures and ensure minimal contact among the public, there will be no in-person registration at schools for P1 registration. You may register your child online in a phase as long as you fulfill at least one of the requirements for that phase.

You may wish to refer to the&nbsp;[MOE P1 Registration website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration) for updates on the P1 Registration Exercise.
