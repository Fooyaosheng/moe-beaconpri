## School Security and Safety

#### 1 \. Visitor Management

All visitors are to observe our school security procedures and report at the security post, before proceeding to the General Office. All visitors are to display their visitor pass without demand. The classroom blocks are strictly out-of-bounds to non-staff. Please arrange with the staff concerned to fix an appointment before your visit.

Please be reminded that you are not to engage directly with other students, especially concerning issues with discipline and behaviour. We take a serious view on this issue. Should there be any matters of concern, please bring it to the attention of our staff for investigation and resolution.

**A. Temperature Taking and Travel Declaration**<br>
In order to safeguard the safety and well-being of our students and staff, visitors are required to adhere to the following before entry into the school premises:

i. Temperature taking for each visit<br>
ii. Travel declaration for each visit

**B. SafeEntry Check-In**

All staff and visitors to the school are required to perform a SafeEntry Check-In via the TraceTogether app or TraceTogether Token upon entering the school, and Check-Out when leaving the school.

**C. Wearing of Masks**<br>
All visitors to the school are required to wear a face mask at all times within the school premises.

#### 2 \. Traffic and Road Safety

For the safety of students and staff, only those with season parking in the school and school buses are allowed to drive into the school in the morning. This arrangement will also take place during slight drizzle as the school is blessed with a sheltered walkway. However, we will allow cars to drive into the school when the rain is heavy.

The drop-off point for students who are ferried to school is at Side Gate 2. The students will alight and enter the school via Side Gate 2. Do be prepared and drop off the students swiftly. Please do not get out of the cars to remove bags from the boots or give last-minute instructions, as this will slow down the traffic further. We appeal to you to be considerate to the security guards and staff on duty as they are trying their best to look into the safety of all students.

#### 3 \. Emergency Drills

In order to prepare our staff and students for an emergency or crisis, the school will be conducting emergency drills such as fire drill, evacuation drill (External Holding Area) and lock down drill. The school has a School Emergency Structure to deal with emergencies to respond, recover and restore the situation back to normalcy.

**Thank you for partnering with the school to keep the environment safe.**
