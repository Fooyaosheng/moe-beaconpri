### School Rules And Practices

#### School Rules
Students must adhere to the school's Code of Conduct and school rules. There will be disciplinary actions for infringement of the school rules and general conduct. The school will take the necessary actions in the best interest of our students, school staff and the community. 

1. **National Anthem and Pledge-Taking**
* Students who are Singapore Citizens must stand at attention when singing the National Anthem and taking the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with their right fists placed over their left chests.

2. **Importance of Punctuality**
* It is important that students develop the good habit of being punctual for school. They should come prepared to start a new school day after a good night's sleep and proper breakfast. The canteen is open for breakfast for those who are early.
* Students who arrive after 7.30 am are considered late. When students arrive late, they will miss essential instructions given at the beginning of the day. Students who are late also feel uncomfortable entering classes when lessons have already started. The following is the process to discourage students from developing the unhealthy habit of being late for school:

3. **Absence from School**<br>
* Students who are absent from school must produce a medical certificate or letter from parents/guardians to state the reason(s) for their absence. Absence from examination/test must be supported with a medical certificate.
* Students' attendance will be marked by teachers using School Cockpit mobile. An alert, via SMS, will be given to parents at 9.30 am if students are not in school. The time of alert is to provide allowance for students who could have been late for school.
* Students are not allowed to miss school during school term. The school does not have the authority to grant leave for students to miss school. Students should not be away from school before the school holidays or report school late when term has started. Only exceptions such as bereavement and serious illnesses of immediate family members will be considered.

4. **Mobile phones and Smart watches**
* Students are strongly discouraged from bringing mobile phones and smart watches to school.
* Digital clocks are available in the classrooms and other venues in the school if the students need to refer to time.
* In times of emergency, students can make telephone calls from the public payphone next to the bookshop.
* If parents need to have urgent contact with their children during school hours in times of emergency, they can call the General Office to leave a message.

5. **Restricted Areas**
* For safety reasons, students are not to enter areas that are out of bounds and areas that require adult supervision such as the school's eco-pond, butterfly haven and fitness playground.

6. **Prohibited Items**
* Students are not allowed to bring any weapon-like item that could be used or intended to be used to cause harm to others.
* Students are not allowed to bring or be in possession of any unauthorised materials that the school deem inappropriate for students.

7. **Games and cards/toys**
* Students are not allowed to bring any trading cards, toys or games to school. Anyone caught bringing/ playing/trading with these items, will face the possibility of confiscation and other consequences.

#### Homework Policy

8. **Purpose of Homework**
* Homework consolidates and reinforces students' learning and cultivates a healthy disposition towards continual learning. It also provides feedback on students' learning progress for themselves and their parents.

9. **Types of Homework**
* Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required to complete outside curriculum time. This includes hardcopy, online assignments, projects and going through learning materials. 

10. **Roles of Parents**
* Set up a regular study routine: Encourage your child to set aside a specific time each day for homework and studying.
* Provide a quiet study space to do his/her homework. This can be a dedicated study room or a corner of the house where there are no distractions.
* Check your child's homework and offer guidance where necessary, but do not do the work for them.
* Communicate with your child's teachers to stay informed about his/her learning progress.
* Provide positive reinforcement - praise your child for his/her efforts and achievements and offer constructive feedback to help him/her improve.

11. **Roles of Students**
* Refer to the whiteboard in the classroom for homework assignments.
* Record the homework assignments in the Beacon Handbook.
* Ensure your homework assignments are brought home to be completed and not left in school.
* Keep track of the homework instructions and deadlines.
* Manage time well to ensure that your homework is completed and submitted on time.
* Give your best effort in completing the homework.
* Review feedback given by teachers on homework submitted.

12. **Homework Load**
* The table below shows the daily homework load. Some students may require less or more time, depending on individual learning needs and styles.

#### Homework Policy

1. **Communication**
* Communication via email to school staff are encouraged. Staff email addresses will be given in introductory letters. They may also be contactable through GO at 67697255.
* All school communication and information will be updated through Parents Gateway (PG). Any changes of parents' email addresses or contact details must be updated through PG.
* Delivering of messages or things (such as books, food, or stationery) to the students are to be avoided to avoid disruption of lessons in class. Students may borrow money from the GO when they forget to bring money for recess or lunch, and return the money the next day. Staff in the GO will contact parents on such requests made by the students.

2. **Photographs and Video Images**
* Please take note that photographs or video images of students or their legal guardians may be taken during school activities and events. The school may use and publish such photographs or video recordings in official channels e.g. school publications and the school website. We would advise parents not to upload photos or videos taken of school or students on other social media platforms.

3. **Birthday Gifts in school**
* The school strongly discourages celebration of students' birthday in school by providing food and gifts for the classmates due to food allergies/ restrictions and unhealthy comparison among children, especially when their birthday gifts to their friends are not reciprocated. The school encourages birthday celebrations at home with loved ones and friends.

4. **Oral Digital Thermometers (ODTs)**
* Students are required to bring their ODTs to school daily and ensure that their ODTs are in good working condition at all times. Students will need to purchase new ODTs if theirs are lost or spoilt. They are to replace the batteries of the ODTs when necessary. ODTs are available from the school bookshop.
Tips for taking your temperature and taking care of your thermometers:
* Check your thermometer to see if it is working.
* Replace the batteries if they are weak.
* Clean the tip of the thermometer before you use it.
* Record your temperature in the handbook.

5. **Travel Declarations**
* Students are to inform the school if they intend to travel overseas during the school holidays. Parents/guardians whose children/wards are travelling overseas need to declare the travel plans via Parents Gateway Mobile App.
