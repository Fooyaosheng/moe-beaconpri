#### NDP 2020 Funpack Artwork Contest

As part of the National Education activities leading up to the National Day Parade on 9 August 2020, the NDP2020 EXCO, together with MOE’s Character and Citizenship Education Branch, organised the&nbsp;[NDP 2020 Funpack Artwork Contest](https://www.ndp.gov.sg/whatshappening/sgtogetherpack/designsbyp5students)**PAGE NOT FOUND**&nbsp;during the recent May school holiday. This contest was open to all Primary 5 students in Singapore. Their artwork had to reflect the theme:&nbsp;**Emerging Stronger Together!**

Only 10 artworks were shortlisted among the nation-wide entries. Among the 10, Beacon Primary School's Ong Yi En's artwork was one of them!

<img style="width:85%" src="/images/NDP Fun Pack 2020.jpg">

Yi En's artwork is titled,&nbsp;**"Hands Up for Singapore"**. Her artwork symbolises the zest and enduring spirit of unity that Singaporeans possess when overcoming challenges.

Each hand is distinct in its representation of the theme. On the extreme left, the mouth-watering chilli crab, tutu kueh, satay, chicken rice and roti prata represent some of our local delicacies, and by extension, the richness of our multicultural society. To the extreme right, Singapore’s distinctive national icons such as the Merlion, the Singapore Flyer and Vanda Miss Joaquim were depicted to remind us of our national identity. Taking centre stage, are the illustrations on the middle hand. It is a representation of our frontline heroes whom Yi En has great respect for.

Well done, Yi En, Beacon is proud of you!
