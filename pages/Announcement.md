### Announcement

As Beacon Primary School will be used as a Polling Station for Presidential Election 2023, we will not be able to hold our Alumni Homecoming on 31 August 2023. We encourage our alumni to write messages to your ex-teachers via email. We thank all alumni for your understanding.

#### No CCA
Dear Parents, this is a reminder that there is no CCA tomorrow (31 Aug 2023). All P1 - P5 students will be dismissed from 10.30am due to Teachers' Day Celebrations. P1 and P2 students with older siblings (P3 - P5) will be able to go home together.
