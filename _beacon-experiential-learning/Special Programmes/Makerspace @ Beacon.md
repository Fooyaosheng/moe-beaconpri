<h3>Makerspace @ Beacon</h3>
<p>Makerspace@Beacon was established for students to bring their ideas to
life.</p>
<p>With an emphasis on <strong>Problem Solving</strong> and <strong>Experiential Learning</strong>,
teachers serve as facilitators for learning, guiding students as they pick
up new skills, while bringing their ideas to realisation.</p>
<p>Using Future <strong>Problem Solving (FPS)</strong> and <strong>Design Think (DT)</strong> as
the guiding principles, students learn to Empathise with an area of concern,
Define a specific challenge to tackle, Ideate for solutions, build a prototype
and to test if their solutions work.</p>
