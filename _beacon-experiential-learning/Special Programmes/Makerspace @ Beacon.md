### Makerspace @ Beacon

Makerspace@Beacon was established for students to bring their ideas to life.

With an emphasis on **Problem Solving** ;and **Experiential Learning**, teachers serve as facilitators for learning, guiding students as they pick up new skills, while bringing their ideas to realisation.

Using Future **Problem Solving (FPS)** and **Design Think (DT)** as the guiding principles, students learn to Empathise with an area of concern, Define a specific challenge to tackle, Ideate for solutions, build a prototype and to test if their solutions work.
