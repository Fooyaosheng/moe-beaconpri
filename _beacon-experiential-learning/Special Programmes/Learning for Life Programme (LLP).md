<p>Beacons have the opportunity to also serve our community partners. Through
these meaningfully curated activities, Beacons develop a sense of responsibility,
empathy, and stronger social skills. Community service also provides practical
knowledge that complements what they learn during lessons. Ultimately,
it inspires students to become active and caring citizens.</p>
