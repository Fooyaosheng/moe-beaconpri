<p>Beacons have the opportunity to also serve the extended community. They
develop responsibility, empathy, and stronger social skills through these
experiences. Community service also provides practical knowledge that complements
what they learn during lessons. Ultimately, it inspires students to become
active and caring citizens.</p>
