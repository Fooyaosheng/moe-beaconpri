<h3>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</h3><p>Beaconâ€™s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is known as Beacon Environmental Stewardship Programme. Beacon Environmental Stewardship Programme aims to develop students with strong commitment to improve the environment in our community. In Beacon, all students are encouraged to practise recycling with a recycle bin placed in each classroom. Other school-wide recycling activities are washing and recycling the metal cans and plastic bottles from the drink stall, recycling used batteries and toilet rolls.</p><p>Other than active recycling in school, our students are also involved in upcycling activities such as making terrarium from recycled containers, coin pouches from milk cartons and making paper boxes from newspapers. They also have a chance to design a prototype solution for an environmental problem they identified by programming with Micro: bit.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BEL/bel_sp05a.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BEL/bel_sp05b.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BEL/bel_sp05c.jpg"></div><p></p><p>Students are also given opportunities to further develop a sense of responsibility for the environment and a personal commitment to protect and preserve the environment by joining the Environmental Science Club.
