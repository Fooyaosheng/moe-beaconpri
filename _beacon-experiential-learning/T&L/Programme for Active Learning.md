### Programme for Active Learning

The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an integral part of the curriculum for Primary 1 and 2 students. PAL offers learning experiences that are active, hands-on, and meaningful. PAL consists of modules with activities in four domains – Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts, and Visual Arts. These activities, which are carried out in school within the curriculum time, are designed to facilitate the development of social and emotional competencies.

#### Sports and Games

During Sports and Games lessons, students have the opportunity to engage in games and practise responsible decision making when they discuss and decide on rules to ensure a fair and safe game. Students are also taught empathy and how to engage different senses as they learn about inclusiveness in sports.

#### Outdoor Education

The Outdoor Education module is designed to engage students in activities involving outdoor elements such as pitching a tent and exploring the eco garden. Students will also get the opportunity to take up an active role in taking care of the environment through the adoption of a plant and observe the changes over time.

#### Performing Arts

Through the Performing Arts module, students are exposed to a variety of drama, dance and music activities that give them opportunities to discover themselves and show care and consideration for others when making decisions as a group.

##### Drama

Through well-known fairy tales like “The Little Red Riding Hood”, students take on the perspectives of others and learn to appreciate diversity using drama strategies such as ‘Hot Seat’ and ‘Freeze Frame’.

##### Music  

Using classical instruments, students reflect upon the sounds made by different instruments to identify the emotions associated with the music. Students also learn to work in groups to create rhythms with musical instruments such as the handbells, shakers and everyday items like cups and plates.

#### Visual Arts

Through a series of art stories told through drawings, shapes and colours, students get to learn how to recognise and label emotions so as to enable them to know their friends better and respond in appropriate ways when listening to different viewpoints.
