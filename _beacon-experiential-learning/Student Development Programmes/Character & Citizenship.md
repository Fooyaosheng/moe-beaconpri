<h4>SHINE Values </h4>
<p>Beacon’s SHINE values drive all character development programmes. The
school explicitly aligned the SHINE values to the Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) learning outcomes and emphasised on having a common language
when delivering CCE curriculum content and experiences. Every Beacon aspires
to be a Contributor, Connector, Constructor, Conductor and a Confident
Learner. Through the SHINE values lessons, students and teachers explore,
reflect and practice on how to be a SHINE-ing Beacon in our daily activities
and actions.</p>
