<h3>Beacons SHINE for Life: Learn, Experience, Live</h3>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) in Beacon is more than just

self. By infusing our SHINE Values into the schools’ learning experiences,
Beacons strive to</p>

<h4>SHINE Values</h4>
<p>Beacon’s SHINE values drive all character development programmes. The
school explicitly aligned the SHINE values to the Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) learning outcomes and emphasised on having a common language
when delivering CCE curriculum content and experiences. Every Beacon aspires
to be a Contributor, Connector, Constructor, Conductor and a Confident
Learner. Through the SHINE values lessons, students and teachers explore,
reflect and practice on how to be a SHINE-ing Beacon in our daily activities
and actions.</p>

<h4>CCE Curriculum Content</h4>
<p>The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity,
Relationships, and Choices, and comprises the teaching and learning of
core values, and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing
a sense of purpose in Beacons. Through the curriculum content areas such
as Cyber Wellness (CW), Mental Health (MH), Sexuality Education (SEd),
Family Education (FE), National Education (NE) and Education and Career
Guidance (ECG), every Beacon has the opportunity to develop a sense of
purpose, identity, belonging, personality and passion in growing into their
unique self.</p>

<h4>Enactment of CCE</h4>
<p>There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality.
These include CCE Lessons during curriculum time, planned student development
learning experiences beyond the classroom, teachable moments during other
subject lessons and learning opportunities beyond school.</p>
<h4>CCE Lesson</h4>
<p>These lessons which include CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), CCE
Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL) provide
the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with their students
through discussions and effective classroom strategies. Broadly, there
are three ways CCE lesson time is used:</p>
<p>i) <strong>explicit teaching of values</strong>, and social and emotional
skills addresses the holistic developmental needs of students, e.g. CCE
(FTGP) / CCE (MTL),
<br>iii) equip students with <strong>knowledge and skills</strong> to better
understand and navigate the real world,
<br>ii) provide <strong>opportunities for contribution</strong> to family, school
and community through VIA projects and leadership tasks.</p>
