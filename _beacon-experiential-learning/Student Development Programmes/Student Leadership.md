### Student Leadership

#### “Every Beacon Is A Leader”

Stemming from the belief that every Beacon is a Leader responsible for the well-being of oneself, society, and nation building, the schooling experience at Beacon aims to nurture Beacons with the necessary skills and values, providing them with opportunities to lead successfully. Our Student Leadership Programme leverages Beacon's SHINE values to provide student leaders with the necessary scaffolding at various tiers, so as to achieve the school’s desired outcomes. Our 3 Tier leadership framework ensures leadership opportunities for every Beacon to lead.

#### Tier 1 Leadership

At Tier 1, students learn to Respect Self – a key driver that encapsulates students’ actions and choices when they lead and conduct themselves as Leaders. Students are given the opportunity to lead within the class so that they take ownership over their class and be role models to their peers.

Leadership roles: Group Leaders/ Asst Group Leaders, Subject Leaders, Class librarians, Class/Canteen Duty Leaders

#### Tier 2 Leadership  

At Tier 2, students exhibit ‘Respect to Friends’ through cohort-based or group based activities. Students shoulder responsibility when they represent the cohort/group in terms of duties assigned in the various areas/ domains. Student Leaders are actively engaged in leading others in carrying out their responsibilities in curriculum/non-curriculum related areas.

Leadership roles: Prefects, CCA Leaders, Class Monitors, AVA Representatives, Green Ambassadors, NE Ambassadors, VIA Ambassadors, Cyber Champs, Student Peer Leaders, Buddy Readers

#### Tier 3 Leadership  

At the highest tier, we have the School's Prefectorial Exco which comprises a body of student leaders elected by their teachers for their exemplary conduct. They help the school in various school events like the Beacon Achievement Ceremony and P1 Orientation Day. Beyond this, they also play a disciplinary role and help to remind fellow students of their conduct and behaviour. As Exco members, they are vested with authority by the school to serve with confidence and conviction.
