### Physical and Health Education

Physical Education (PE) plays an important role in the holistic education of our students. Research has shown that children who are physically active tend to be more focused and motivated in school. In Beacon Primary School, we aim to nurture in our students the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. These are achieved through engaging, enjoyable, and quality PE lessons that develop our students to become competent movers.

At the lower primary level (Primary 1 and Primary 2), students learn fundamental movement skills and explore movement concepts. As students grow and mature (from Primary 3 - Primary 6), they will be engaged in developmentally appropriate learning activities which allow them to transfer their skills across the learning areas of Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, and Physical Health and Fitness.

Other than daily PE lessons, the PE department also organizes special programmes such as SwimSafer 2.0 Programme , Sports Day , Primary 4 and Primary 5 Cohort Camps.
