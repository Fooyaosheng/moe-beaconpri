<h3>Physical and Health Education</h3>
<p>In Beacon, Physical and Health Education (PHE) is an integral part of
every student's holistic development. We aim to inspire and empower our
students to lead active and healthy lifestyles while fostering a lifelong
love for physical activity and sports.</p>

<h4>Infusing 21CC into PHE</h4>
<p>Our PHE lessons do not only enhance physical fitness but also integrate
the teaching of values and 21st-century competencies. Through authentic
contexts, students are exposed to life situations that facilitate perspective-taking,
relationship management, and moral action.</p>
