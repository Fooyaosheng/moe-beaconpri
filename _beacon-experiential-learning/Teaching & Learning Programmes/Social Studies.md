<h3>Social Studies</h3>
<p>Social Studies (SS) aims to prepare Beacons to be citizens of tomorrow
by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness between Singapore
and the world they live in and appreciate the complexities of the human
experiences from past to present.</p>
<p>Beacons get to be curious on real-life issues, understand current affairs
and develop multiple perspectives through inquiry-based learning. SS gives
Beacons the opportunity to develop deeper understanding of the values that
define the Singaporean society and nurture disposition to show concern
for the world they live in. It also provides an avenue to demonstrate empathy
in their relationships with others.</p>
<p>In Beacon, SS is experienced in an Active, Reflective and Collective approach.
Beacons are actively engaged in discussions, reflective on the impact of
current and contemporary issues and collective in creating meaning and
identity of themselves as a Singaporean and as a global citizen.</p>

<p>To develop Beacons to be informed and concerned citizens, our SS programme
brings learning beyond the classroom. Beacons go on learning journeys to
have authentic experiences on understanding our national history, learn
from the experts and reflect on how our past impacts our present.</p>
