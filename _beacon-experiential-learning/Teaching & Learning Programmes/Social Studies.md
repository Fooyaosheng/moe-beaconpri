### Social Studies

Social Studies (SS) aims to prepare Beacons to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness between Singapore and the world they live in and appreciate the complexities of the human experiences from past to present.

Beacons get to be curious on real-life issues, understand current affairs and develop multiple perspectives through inquiry based learning. SS gives Beacons the opportunity to develop deeper understanding of the values that define the Singaporean society and nurture disposition to show concern for the world they live in. It also provides an avenue to demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.

In Beacon, SS is experienced in an Active, Reflective and Collective approach. Beacons are **actively engaged** in discussions, **reflective on the impact** of current and contemporary issues and **collective in creating meaning and identity** of themselves as a Singaporean and as a global citizen.

To develop Beacons to be informed and concerned citizens, our SS programme brings learning beyond the classroom. Beacons go on learning journeys to have authentic experiences on understanding our national history, learn from the experts and reflect on how our past impacts our present.
