### Mathematics

The Mathematics Department aims to enable all students to:

*   acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in mathematics
*   develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application, and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving
*   build confidence and foster interest in mathematics

To achieve the objectives, teachers strive to make mathematics&nbsp;_simple_,&nbsp;_thoughtful,_&nbsp;and&nbsp;_fun_&nbsp;for all students.

**SimpleMaths**: Teachers adopt varied teaching approaches to simplify the learning of mathematics. Through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach, students acquire mathematical concepts and skills. As problem-solving is central to mathematics learning, students learn Polya’s 4 essential steps – Understand, Plan, Solve, and Check – to solving problems. In addition, ICT is meaningfully infused into lessons for students to explore, collaborate and deepen their learning.

**ThoughtfulMaths**: Teachers nurture a classroom culture that allows students to develop thinking, reasoning, and metacognitive skills. Through journaling and presentations, students are given the opportunities to communicate, reason and reflect on their mathematical thinking.

**FunMaths**: Students learn better through play. The use of physical and digital manipulatives allows the students to actively participate in the learning process and allow them to discover and understand mathematical concepts. Games and stories are embedded into lessons to engage the students. Primary 1 and 2 students also embark on learning trails to discover and apply mathematical skills and concepts in a real-world context.

#### Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme

The E2K Mathematics programme caters to selected Primary 4 to 6 students who demonstrate interest and ability in mathematics. It offers opportunities for students to collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and explorations which are specifically designed to hone their mathematical skills.&nbsp;

#### Mathematics Olympiad Training

Primary 3 to 6 students who have an interest in mathematics and are keen to improve their mathematical skills are invited to join the Olympiad training. These training sessions help them to think critically and creatively in problem-solving. Students will be given the opportunity to apply what they have learnt in Mathematics competitions such as the Singapore Maths Kangaroo Contest (SMKC), and Singapore and Asian Schools Maths Olympiad (SASMO).

#### Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)

The LSM programme provides early intervention support in acquiring basic numeracy skills for identified Primary 1 to 3 students. In a small group setting, trained teachers make use of a variety of strategies such as scaffolding and visual representation to help deepen their understanding of the concepts learnt.

#### Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)

The ICAN programme aims to better support and motivate students to acquire knowledge and skills in numeracy, enhance memory retention and raise their confidence levels in mathematics through intervention strategies and principles that are guided by research.
