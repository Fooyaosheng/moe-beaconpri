#### MTL Curriculum

The Beacon MTL curriculum focuses on the functional use of Mother Tongue Languages, with greater emphasis on listening and speaking skills as the cornerstone of language proficiency. Students are also provided with the opportunity to further enhance their language-learning capabilities through cultural exchanges and other practical opportunities for greater appreciation of the language and culture.

As students learn their Mother Tongue Language through the curriculum, there is a close connection to their daily life and interests, e.g. animation, digital interactive games, and authentic language tasks. 

#### ICT for Learning in the MTL Curriculum

Students’ learning in MTL lessons are enriched with various digital resources via online platforms. With the online resources, students extend their learning beyond the classroom. Students are also able to revisit the learning content at their own pace.<br>
