#### Objectives

We aim to make Football an enjoyable CCA for both competitive and recreational players. We hope to provide opportunities for students who are interested to participate in this exciting sport. We inculcate values such as teamwork, resilience and confidence, so that our students can develop holistically as football players. Members in the recreational group learn basic football skills and tactics through simple drills and games. Members who show potential will be selected to represent the school in inter-school competitions.
