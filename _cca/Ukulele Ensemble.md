#### Objectives

The Ukulele Ensemble CCA aims to nurture students with the passion for the performing arts through an instrumental ensemble. Students will learn the basic techniques of ukulele-playing and develop sight-reading and ensemble skills. The CCA also seeks to nurture confidence in students and provide opportunities to hone showmanship skills, while inculcating discipline, teamwork and resilience through performances in school events.

#### Main Activities

Sessions are planned and guided by professional instructors. The ukulele sessions encompass all aspects of ukulele playing, including chord reading, strumming and plucking patterns, and melody playing (ranging from tunes of popular songs to classical music) arranged for ukulele. Through the CCA, students interact and bond amongst teams, combining the playing of chords and melodies to songs. By learning a musical skill together, students can have fun through the learning process.
