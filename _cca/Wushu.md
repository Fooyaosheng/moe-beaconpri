*   Help students gain a better understanding and appreciation towards Wushu
*   Foster team building and cohesion by providing opportunities for students to work as a team
*   Provide opportunities for students to develop their leadership potential and abilities
*   Develop a sense of self-motivation in Wushu through cultivating the students’ passion for the sports
*   Provide an avenue for all members to showcase their hard work through the years, allowing each member to shine on stage.

#### Main Activities

*   Students who have just joined the CCA will be learning the basic Wushu footwork and movements.
*   After acquiring the basic movements, they will branch out into learning different routines and different Wushu weapons such as the Sword, Broad Sword, Cudgel or Spear.
*   Members who have shown great interest and excel in any routines will be selected to join the School Team. They will be training for the National School Games Wushu Competition in individual or group routines.
*   Aside from competition, Wushu is also actively involved in school performances such as Chinese New Year and the Year End Beacon Awards Ceremony Performance.
