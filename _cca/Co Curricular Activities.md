### Co-Curricular Activities

CCA is an important part of our students’ holistic education and development. CCA enables students to realise their potential by providing them with opportunities to discover their interests and talents. In Beacon Primary School, we aim to cultivate in our students the joy of learning so that they are motivated to pursue their interests and talents in the long run. Our CCAs also emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds.

#### CCA Policy

*   Students are encouraged to actively participate in one CCA from P3 onward.
*   Students must have at least 75% of attendance to constitute a member of any CCA.
*   Students should not be absent from CCA without a valid reason.
*   Students are strongly encouraged to remain in their CCA throughout their primary school journey. This is to provide an opportunity for progression and allow time for students to develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation.
*   Students are not allowed to change CCA within the same academic year; however, they may request for a change of CCA at the end of P3. A written request (letter or email) will be required if a parent/guardian intends to change the child/ward’s CCA. Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
