#### Objectives

The Percussion CCA seeks to inculcate students’ interests in the performing arts by participating in music events at both non-competitive and competitive level. The performing aspect helps students to build confidence when they express themselves and communicate with the audience through percussion music. The learning process of playing in an ensemble also develops teamwork, resilience and the spirit of excellence.

#### Main Activities

Students are trained by professional instructors to play a selection of percussion instruments using the correct technique. To help build up and strengthen students’ proficiency level, practice sessions include various rhythmic pattern playing using drumming techniques. From rhythmic exercises to traditional and contemporary (including fusion) performing pieces, Percussion CCA offers a rich and engaging cultural experience for the students.
