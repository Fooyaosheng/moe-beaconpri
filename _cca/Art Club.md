#### Objectives  

Art Club offers students with interest in visual arts an avenue to come together and hone their artistic talent through meaningful art experiences. Student-artists get to explore new art techniques, expand their knowledge in art and cultivate their spirit of creativity, innovation, and experimentation through art.

Through teacher-led activities, the Art Club aims to enable students to:

*   Be able to express their feelings appropriately.
*   Persevere to commit to complete each task to the best of their abilities.
*   Learn to cooperate with others to achieve the same goal.
*   Be able to critique their own work and the work of their peers and established artists in positive and constructive ways.

#### Main Activities

Sessions are planned and guided by the Studio Habits of Mind framework. Student-artists develop their craft through the exploration of traditional art mediums and unconventional materials. The teacher-led sessions are scaffolded for students to visually conceptualise ideas, enabling them to express their thoughts, imagination and emotions. Some examples of activities include batik painting, paper weaving, printmaking, tie-dye, clay sculpting, digital art, outdoor drawing, and learning journey to art museums. The Art club also participates actively in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Visual Arts Exhibition.
