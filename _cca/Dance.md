#### Objectives

The Dance CCA started in 2022, following the amalgamation of Chinese Dance and Malay
Dance CCAs. It aims to amplify students’ interest in dance through the mastery of diverse dance
genres from classical to contemporary, jazz and hip hop, and instill resilience and discipline
alongside other school values in them. With a structured intensive program that teaches skills,
improvisation techniques and choreography and platforms to perform, we hope to bring out the
best in each of our dancers and nurture them with the qualities that would carry them through
their academic and non-academic pursuits.

#### Main Activities

1. Exercises for body core strengthening as well as cardiovascular and muscle conditioning.
2. Choreography in preparation for school-based performances, including Morning Assembly,
Open House and National Day concerts.
3. Trainings for Singapore Youth Festival 2024.
