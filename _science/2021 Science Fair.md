## 2021 Science Fair

The 2021 Beacon Science Fair was conducted virtually over the June holidays this year. Like the previous run in 2020, moving the Science Fair online allows our students to still be given the opportunity and platform to explore and appreciate the science around them in this new norm. The theme for this year's Science Fair was ‘Science Around Us’. Registration for the 2021 Science Fair started in May 2021 for students from Primary 3 to Primary 6. They registered either for the individual or sibling category. Watch the slideshow below for the exciting projects by our budding young scientists.
