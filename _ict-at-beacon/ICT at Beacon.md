## ICT at Beacon

The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Beacon Primary School is integrated into the teaching and learning programmes. The school aims to develop every Beacon to achieve their highest potential, with the spirit of creativity and innovation.

ICT at Beacon adopts a 3-stage model, segmenting the student population into 3 levels: lower, middle and upper primary. At the three levels, learning tasks are designed within the school's curriculum to incorporate the explicit learning of [New Media Literacies (NML)](/ict-at-beacon/nml/) and its abilities of **Curate**, **Create** and **Connect**.

#### Lower Primary - Learn to Use

Students in the lower primary are introduced to ICT tools and basic skills in using the devices and their applications. Some of these skills include account management, web navigation, using search engines, etc.

#### Middle Primary - Use to Learn  

With the basics of being learnt, students in the middle primary engage in more independent learning tasks such as research and journaling. Students also learn to engage in online platforms that allow them to collaborate and connect with their peers.

#### Upper Primary - Use to Create

Upper primary students will engage in projects that allow them to extend their learning based on their own interests, taking part in online discussion forums with their classmates and exchanging ideas, and creating content for their peers and the community.
