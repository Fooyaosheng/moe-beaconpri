### Professional Development

**Building Competent and Caring Staff**

As quality staff is a key enabler in realising our Vision and achieving the Desired Outcomes, Beacon Primary School aims to develop its staff who are competent in nurturing the students to achieve their full potential and are guided by their care for the students and the community in school. The school focuses on teachersâ€™ competencies in teaching and learning, mainly in the areas of Curriculum, Pedagogy, Assessment and Classroom Management.

Apart from attending workshops and courses to develop themselves professionally, the school recognises the value of on-the-job training, peer-to-peer collaboration and sharing of good practices as a powerful development tools. Several platforms in school provide opportunities for sharing and professional growth.

#### PD Visit

30 staff from Beacon Primary School conducted a learning journey to My First Skool (MFS) at 6 Segar Road in 2023. Principal of MFS shared on the school's curriculum and programmes and conducted a tour for our staff. The learning at the preschool helps us in planning our programmes for the lower primary students.
