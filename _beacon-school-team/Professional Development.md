### Professional Development

**Building Competent and Caring Staff**

As quality staff is a key enabler in realising our Vision and achieving the Desired Outcomes, Beacon Primary School aims to develop
our staff who are competent in nurturing the students to achieve their full potential and are guided by their care for the students and
the community in school. The school focuses on teachersâ€™ competencies in teaching and learning, mainly in the areas of Curriculum,
Pedagogy, Assessment and Classroom Management.

In addition to attending external workshops and courses to develop themselves professionally, the school recognises the value of peer-
to-peer collaboration, sharing of good practices, learning journeys to other organisations and on-the-job training as powerful
development tools. Hence, time and space are set aside for staff to be engaged in these meaningful sharing/ learning opportunities at
school level for their professional growth.
