<img src="/images/SL Photo.jpg" style="width:85%">

<p align="center">Ms Pang Wee Mian (P), Mdm Lela Shamsuhadi (VP), Mr Chen Wei Ngiap (VP), Mrs Melissa Loh-Chang Suet Mun (VP)</p>

<font size=1>Thank you for visiting our school website. You will be able to gather information on what we stand for and the learning opportunities we offer to both students and staff in our school. Please visit our page on Event Gallery and enjoy the delightful faces of students and staff in the various activities that we had. We will be holding our physical Open House on 1 July 2023. Do look out for details nearer the date and join us on this day.Â 

Our focus has always been to provide meaningful learning experiences for our students and staff. We want students and staff to be motivated in their daily encounters and be inspired as they reflect upon the memories of time well spent. We give emphasis to responsible use of resources as we consider the harm done to the environment.

We aim to nurture good learning habits and a resilient attitude (Constructor and Conductor) in our students, help them to develop empathy and a heart for others (Contributor and Connector). We hope that the meaningful and positive learning experiences in Beacon Primary will instill the confidence (Confident Learner) in our students that they should be able to ride the storms ahead of them.

We look forward to 2023 with great anticipation as bring back more programmes and activities to enhance the learning experiences of both students and staff.

Happy Reading!
