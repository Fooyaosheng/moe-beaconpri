Our learning environment includes both physical and virtual spaces. These spaces have been designed and developed to support the school’s ICT-enriched curriculum. The flexibility and interconnectedness of the physical spaces facilitate collaborative and independent learning, and support pedagogical change.

Our physical learning space has also been greatly extended and enhanced by the Zhenghua Park, located right next to the school. The park offers a natural and an authentic outdoor ‘classroom’ and supports the school’s Outdoor Education under the Programme for Active Learning (PAL).

The learning environment at Beacon also extends beyond the physical one to include the virtual space. Virtual learning spaces open up new opportunities for learning and offer rich learning resources and information, allowing students to learn beyond the confines of the classrooms and textbooks.

In Beacon, our engaging environment also includes our support for the students’ well-being so as to create a holistic and positive Beacon Experience.
