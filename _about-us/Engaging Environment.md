<h3>Engaging Environment</h3>
<p>Our learning environment includes both physical and virtual spaces. The
flexibility and interconnectedness of the physical spaces facilitate collaborative
and independent learning and support pedagogical change. Virtual learning
spaces open new opportunities for learning and offer rich learning resources
and information, allowing students to learn beyond the confines of the
classrooms and textbooks.</p>

<p>Our learning environment includes both physical and virtual spaces. These
spaces have been designed and developed to support the school’s ICT-enriched
curriculum. The flexibility and interconnectedness of the physical spaces
facilitate collaborative and independent learning and support pedagogical
change.</p>

<p>Our physical learning space has also been greatly extended and enhanced
by the Zhenghua Park, located right next to the school. The park offers
a natural and an authentic outdoor ‘classroom’ and supports the school’s
Outdoor Education under the Programme for Active Learning (PAL).</p>

<p>The learning environment at Beacon also extends beyond the physical one
to include the virtual space. Virtual learning spaces open up new opportunities
for learning and offer rich learning resources and information, allowing
students to learn beyond the confines of the classrooms and textbooks.</p>
<p>In Beacon, our engaging environment also includes our support for the
students’ well-being so as to create a holistic and positive Beacon Experience.</p>
