## Food From the Heart

#### 2020 Food From the Heart Donation Drive

Every year, as part of school’s Values in Action (VIA) and in collaboration with Food From the Heart, Beacon Primary School organises a food donation drive to encourage students to donate non-perishable food items. This year, we received an overwhelming response from our Beacons. We are very glad for the strong support given to the Project by our Beacons.

Visit the [Event Gallery]**INPUT ISOMER SITE** to see the enthusiastic participation from our Beacons and the amount of food collected this year.

A big thank you to all students, staff and parents, for your support towards this meaningful project.
