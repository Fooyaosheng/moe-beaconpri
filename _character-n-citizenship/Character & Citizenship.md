## Character & Citizenship

Beacon’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum is designed to build character and inculcate values that are aligned to the school’s MVV and MOE’s framework for 21st century competencies and outcomes.

In our efforts to nurture students to be a gracious community of active and creative learners who are global in outlook, grounded in basics and rooted in values, our CCE Department adopts a whole-school approach to ensure that students are provided a holistic Beacon Experience. The teaching of CCE is developmental and progressive, with structured programmes for each level, and is delivered through direct teaching, teachable moments and infusion in the following 3 areas, CCE Curriculum, CCE Experience and Formal Curriculum. With the 3Cs as our guiding principles, ‘Common Language’, ‘Concrete Experience’ and ‘Consistent Delivery’, Beacons are provided with opportunities to acquire these competencies through our diverse and balanced curriculum that support students' development and well-being.
