<h3>Enactment of CCE</h3>
<p>There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality.
These include CCE Lessons during curriculum time, planned student development
learning experiences beyond the classroom, teachable moments during other
subject lessons and learning opportunities beyond school.</p>
<h4>CCE Lesson</h4>
<p>These lessons which include CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), CCE
Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL) provide
the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with their students
through discussions and effective classroom strategies. Broadly, there
are three ways CCE lesson time is used:</p>
<p>i) <strong>explicit teaching of values</strong>, and social and emotional
skills addresses the holistic developmental needs of students, e.g. CCE
(FTGP) / CCE (MTL),</p>
<p>iii) equip students with <strong>knowledge and skills</strong> to better
understand and navigate the real world,</p>
<p>ii) provide <strong>opportunities for contribution</strong> to family, school
and community through VIA projects and leadership tasks.</p>

<h4>Sexuality Education</h4>
<p>The Sexuality Education programme in Beacon Primary School follows the
syllabus set by MOE. The programme aims to:</p>
<p>Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop healthy relationships.</p>
<p>Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.</p>
<p>Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others
by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that
are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>

<h4>Enhancing Social Emotional Learning through Executive Functioning Skills</h4>
<p>Executive Function (EF) refers to a set of skills that are essential for
learners to develop the capacity to plan ahead and meet goals, display
self-control, follow multi-step directions and stay focused despite distractions.
This forms a foundation for self-regulation to help children build social-emotional
skills and prepare them for learning. Beacon customises and designs lessons
to build EF skills in a progressive manner. Classroom practices and school
routines are platforms for students to practise these EF skills daily to
ensure consistency.</p>

<p>The Beacon Experience aims to provide programmes and activities that contribute
towards the holistic development of our Beacons in the physical, aesthetic,
intellectual, moral and social domains. The experiences provide authentic
opportunities for Beacons to apply and display their SHINE Values.</p>
