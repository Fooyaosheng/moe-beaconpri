### Sexuality Education Programme

The Sexuality Education programme in Beacon Primary School follows the syllabus set by MOE. The programme aims to:

*   Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional changes as they grow up and develop healthy relationships.
*   Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.
*   Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.
